This site is a project to gather the thoughts of Catholic women on the verses Bible. It is not meant to exclude the thoughts of men, but only to recognize the perspective women bring to the faith which is both equal in dignity and different. It is our hope that what we find by bringing these thoughts together is something that will enrich the whole Church. We entrust this project to the Blessed Mother as we gather the writings of her daughters. 

Welcome to *Our Lady's Commentary*.
